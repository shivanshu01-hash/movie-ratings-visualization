# 🎬 Movie Ratings - EDA & Advanced Visualization

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Advanced Data Visualization** on a movie ratings dataset using Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

## 📁 Project Structure

-data/ – Contains the CSV file (Movie-Rating.csv)
-notebooks/ – Jupyter Notebook for EDA and visualizations
-Movie_Visualization_EDA.ipynb
-images/ – (Optional) Save your plots here
-.gitignore – To ignore unnecessary files in Git
-README.md – Project overview and instructions
-requirements.txt – List of required Python libraries

## 📌 Objective

- Perform in-depth EDA on movie rating data
- Use Seaborn & Matplotlib for aesthetic and informative visualizations
- Identify patterns, correlations, and trends in ratings, genres, durations, etc.

## 📊 Features Covered

- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Univariate and multivariate analysis
- Genre-based comparisons
- Ratings vs. Duration plots
- Heatmaps, KDE plots, boxplots, violinplots, and more
- Custom background and themes in Seaborn

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
- (Optional: Streamlit for web deployment)

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used is located in `/data/Movie-Rating.csv`.  
You may replace it with any movie ratings dataset following a similar structure.
