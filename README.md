# Movie Ratings - EDA & Advanced Visualization

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Advanced Data Visualization** on a movie ratings dataset using Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

## Project Structure

- **data/** – Contains the CSV file (`Movie-Rating.csv`)
- **notebooks/** – Jupyter Notebook for EDA and visualizations  
  - `Movie_Visualization_EDA.ipynb`
- **images/** – (Optional) Save your plots here
- **.gitignore** – To ignore unnecessary files in Git
- **README.md** – Project overview and instructions
- **requirements.txt** – List of required Python libraries

## Objective

- Perform in-depth EDA on movie rating data
- Use Seaborn & Matplotlib for aesthetic and informative visualizations
- Identify patterns, correlations, and trends in ratings, genres, durations, etc.

## Features Covered

- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Univariate and multivariate analysis
- Genre-based comparisons
- Ratings vs. Duration plots
- Heatmaps, KDE plots, boxplots, violinplots, and more
- Custom background and themes in Seaborn

## Tech Stack

- Python 
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
- (Optional: Streamlit for web deployment)

## Dataset

The dataset used is located in `/data/Movie-Rating.csv`.  
You may replace it with any movie ratings dataset following a similar structure.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shivanshu01-hash/Movie-Ratings-EDA.git
cd Movie-Ratings-EDA
```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Open Jupyter Notebook  
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

4. Explore the notebook: `Movie_Visualization_EDA.ipynb`

## Requirements

```
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
```

## Future Scope

- Add Streamlit app for web-based interactive dashboard
- Merge with IMDb or TMDB API for live data
- Use NLP to analyze movie reviews
